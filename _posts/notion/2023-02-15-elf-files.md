| Section Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example in C Code                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.text`      | Contains the executable instructions of the program. It includes the main entry point and other functions or code segments.                                                                           | `void main() { ... }`                                    |
| `.data`      | Holds initialized global and static variables. This section is typically read-write, allowing modifications to the data during program execution.                                                     | `int global_var = 10;`
static `int global_var = 10;`     |
| `.bss`       | Stands for "Block Started by Symbol." It stores uninitialized global and static variables. The section doesn't consume space in the file but gets allocated in memory during program execution.       | `static int uninitialized_var;`
`int uninitialized_var;` |
| `.rodata`    | Read-only data section, which contains constants and other read-only data such as string literals. This section is typically mapped as read-only in memory.                                           | `const char* const_message = "Hello, World!";`           |
| `.got`       | Global Offset Table (GOT) contains entries for resolving global symbols and function calls. It is used during dynamic linking to determine the memory addresses of symbols or functions.              | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.plt`       | Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) holds a series of stubs or trampolines for function calls. These stubs help in resolving symbols during dynamic linking by jumping to the appropriate entry in the GOT. | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.rel.text`  | Relocation entries specific to the `.text` section, containing information on addresses that need to be updated when the code is loaded at a different base address.                                  | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.rel.data`  | Relocation entries specific to the `.data` section, containing information on addresses that need to be updated when the data section is loaded at a different base address.                          | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.debug`     | Contains debugging information, such as symbol tables, line numbers, and debugging symbols, used by debuggers and other development tools.                                                            | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.dynamic`   | Stores dynamic linking information, including shared libraries dependencies, symbol tables, and relocation entries. It is used by the dynamic linker/loader at runtime.                               | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.symtab`    | Symbol table containing information about various symbols defined or referenced in the program, such as function and variable names, their memory addresses, and other attributes.                    | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.strtab`    | String table that holds the null-terminated strings referenced by entries in the symbol table. Each entry in the symbol table refers to an offset within this section.                                | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.shstrtab`  | Section header string table, which contains names of all the sections in the ELF file. It allows easy lookup and identification of sections by their names.                                           | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.note`      | Contains optional notes or auxiliary information, such as file version details or build-specific information.                                                                                         | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.comment`   | Optional section that may store additional comments or annotations related to the program or object file.                                                                                             | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.interp`    | Specifies the program interpreter, which is responsible for loading and executing the program.                                                                                                        | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.dynstr`    | String table holding null-terminated strings used by the dynamic linker/loader, such as library names or function names required for dynamic linking.                                                 | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.dynsym`    | Symbol table containing dynamic symbol entries that are used for dynamic linking. It holds information about symbols defined in shared libraries used by the program.                                 | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.dynstrtab` | String table used by the dynamic linker/loader, similar to `.dynstr`, but for symbol table entries.                                                                                                   | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.rela.text` | Relocation entries with addend for the `.text` section, used in systems that require explicit addends for relocations.                                                                                | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
| `.rela.data` | Relocation entries with addend for the `.data` section, used in systems that require explicit addends for relocations.                                                                                | N/A (Does not have a direct representation in C code)    |
