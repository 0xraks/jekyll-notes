## Management Frames


Used for the control of the wireless network and the devices that connect to it. Management frames can be used for establishing and maintaining connections, as well as for signaling important events like re-association or authentication.

## Data Frames


Data frames can be used for two main purposes: to transfer information or to trigger an event. It is worth mentioning that not all data frames have a payload. Some of them, referred to as "null data frames", only have a header and trailer.

# Display Filter Macros


Display Filter Macros are a mechanism to create shortcuts for complex filters. For example, defining a display filter macro named _tcp_conv_ whose text is


```c
(wlan.addr == $1 && wlan.addr == $2) || (wlan.addr == $2 && wlan.addr == $1 && wlan.type.eq(0) && wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x1D)
